    <h2> Java Basics</h2>
    <h3>What is Java</h3>
    <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is platform-independent, which means we can write code once and run it anywhere using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is mostly used for building desktop applications, web applications, Android apps, and enterprise systems.</p>
    <h3>Key Features of Java</h3>
    <p><b>Platform Independent: </b>Java is known for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) capability. This means that once you write a Java program, you can run it on any device or operating system that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), without modifying the code.</p>
    <p><b>Simple: </b>Java has a clean and easy-to-understand syntax, making it a great choice for beginners. It avoids complicated features like pointers and multiple inheritance, which can confuse new programmers.</p>
    <p><b>Object Oriented: </b>Java is a fully object-oriented programming (OOP) language. It organizes code into objects and classes, which makes your code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.</p>
    <p><b>Secured: </b>Java includes many built-in features that make programs more secure. Since it doesn't use pointers and runs inside the JVM, it helps prevent memory leaks and unauthorized access.</p>
    <p><b>Multi Threading: </b>Java allows you to run multiple tasks at the same time using something called threads. This is very useful for tasks like running games, managing multiple users, or processing payments all at once.</p>
    <p><b>Just In Time(JIT) Compiler: </b>Java uses a JIT compiler to improve performance. The JIT compiler converts Java bytecode into machine code at runtime, which helps the program run faster and more efficiently.

    <h3>Hello World Example</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-java">
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  }
}
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Lets try to understand the code:</h3>

    <p><pre>public class HelloWorld</pre>
This line creates a class called HelloWorld. In Java, every program must be inside a class.

<pre>public static void main(String[] args)</pre>
This is the main method. It's where the program starts running. Every Java program must have this line.

<pre>System.out.println("Hello, world!");</pre>
This line prints the message Hello, world! on the screen.<br>
System is a built-in Java class.<br>
out is the output stream (like your screen).<br>
println means “print a line”.</p>
