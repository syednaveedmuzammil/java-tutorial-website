    <h2>Java Buzz Words</h2>
    <p>Java was designed with a specific set of features in mind. These features are often called Java Buzzwords, they are the guiding principles that shaped the design and behavior of the Java programming language.<br><br>These buzzwords summarize what makes Java powerful, popular, and different from other programming languages. They highlight Java’s core strengths, such as being secure, portable, and easy to use.</p>
    <p><b>Simple: </b>Easy to learn and write. Java removes confusing features like pointers and operator overloading.</p>
    <p><b>Object Oriented: </b>Everything in Java is an object. It helps keep your code organized and reusable.</p>
    <p><b>Secure: </b>Java runs inside a virtual machine and has strong security features like no pointer access.</p>
    <p><b>Platform Independent: </b>Write Once, Run Anywhere-Java code runs on any device with a JVM.</p>
    <p><b>Robust: </b>Java handles errors well and avoids crashes through strong memory management.</p>
    <p><b>Multi Threading: </b>Java can run many tasks at the same time (using threads). Great for games and real-time apps.</p>
    <p><b>Architecture Neutral: </b>Java code doesn’t depend on a specific computer architecture, so it works everywhere.</p>
    <p><b>Portable: </b>Java programs can easily move from one computer to another without changes.</p>
    <p><b>High performance: </b>Java uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to run fast, though not as fast as C/C++.</p>
    <p><b>Distributed: </b>Java can build programs that work across networks — great for web apps and client-server systems.</p>
    <p><b>Dynamic: </b>Java can adapt while it’s running. It loads new classes and libraries as needed.</p>
